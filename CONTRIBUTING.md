# How to contribute

We are really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/H21-glo2003-equipe4/glo2003-h21-projet-h21-equipe04/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Testing

We use JUnit and Google Truth to test our project. Don't forget to add new unit tests when needed.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Ebaie](https://github.com/H21-glo2003-equipe4/glo2003-h21-projet-h21-equipe04/pull/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Before you send a pull request, make sure to create a related issue (read more about [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)) an to link them.

Also Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Firstly our project architecture is based on the Clean Code, all added code should follow this convention.

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

For all other coding conventions, refer to our checkstyle to check if your coding style fits our conventions.

Thanks,
The Ebaie Team
